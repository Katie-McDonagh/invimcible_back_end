## Level structure

1. Vim has left the hairdressers only to discover his bike is not where he remembered tying it up. Use ‘hjkl’ to help Vim search for his quite expensive bike. He has to ask a wise peer ‘where is my bike?’ using the command ‘i’. The first level is given freely to the user.
2. Vim’s bike has been stolen! Vim encounters a helpful peer, Tristvim, who tells him where the thief went. Use ‘b’ and ‘w’ to help Vim to chase the thief and jump over potholes. He has to ask a wise peer ‘where did the thief go?’ using the command ‘i’. It is partially completed. 
3. A door is locked until Vim can delete the word ‘not’ in ‘not open’. Use the command ‘x’ to do so.
4. Use the command ‘i’ to insert a cape to help Vim feel more empowered about losing his bike.
5. Vim loses the thief in the pursuit. He realises he has to file a claim  with his insurance company. Help Vim locate his insurance papers by using the commands ‘xyz’.
